# Library A-Z Link Checker

## Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of checking links on
a library‚Äôs A-Z resources page. It performs web scraping, link
collection, and link validation to check resources are accessible.

It may produce false positives or false negatives, so doesn‚Äôt entirely
remove the need for manual validation, but should catch most broken
links.

## Features

- üï∑Ô∏è Web Scraping: Uses Playwright to collect links from the library‚Äôs
  A-Z page
- üîó Link Validation: Checks the status of each collected link
- üìä Reporting: Generates detailed CSV reports of link statuses
- üìß Notifications: Sends email alerts about broken links
- ‚è∞ Scheduled Runs: Automatically checks links weekly
